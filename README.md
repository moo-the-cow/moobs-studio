Docker linux container (nvidia GPU enabled) for cloud and selfhosting

the image will be around 4.5GB (keep in mind that you will have a linux desktop available for your own convenience) and there are a lot of dependencies, so I cannot really shrink the size

This setup was tested on a windows machine using WSL (Ubuntu 20.04) and NVIDIA Cuda activated
