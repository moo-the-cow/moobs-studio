Docker linux container (nvidia GPU enabled) for cloud and selfhosting

the image will be around 4.5GB (keep in mind that you will have a linux desktop available for your own convenience) and there are a lot of dependencies, so I cannot really shrink the size

This setup was tested on a windows machine using WSL (Ubuntu 20.04) and NVIDIA Cuda for docker activated

On a native linux environment NVIDIA HW acceleration is even easier to use

For cloud setup I cannot post any hints, because I do not have any cloud setup and also this may be different depending which cloud environment you use.
But you will defnitely need some NVIDIA GPU supported
